# Coordinate2

This is a language branched off of [coordinate](https://github.com/madeforlosers/coordinate), marked as the "better" version.

Originally, I wrote coordinate in Node.js. I got so pissed off by Node.js that I decided to code coordinate in an entirely different language I only have experience for in my coding classes. I would like to thank Google, W3Schools, StackOverflow, and GeeksForGeeks as contributers. NO AI!!!

This is still a work in progress. As far as I know, the command interpreter is finished (unless theres a few bugs, which there probably is), so all I gotta do is add the commands. Of course, there will be a few I can't add back, or am not willing to add back because I'm too lazy.

This also means that the original coordinate repository (when i get this finished) will be DEPRECATED!! THIS is the better version! Trust me!
